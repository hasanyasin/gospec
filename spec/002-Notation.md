# Notation

I love learning new languages and Go is one of the best that I have ever
studied. The spec uses EBNF for specifying syntax. Although a
[Metasyntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntax) is very useful to express
the rules very clearly without causing any confusion, it is really not the most
readable piece of text. Since the spec already provides this formal
representation, I believe it wouldn't hurt to have a less-concrete; but much
more readable style.

So I will specify Go language syntax in a more visual and easy-to-read fashion.

Let's give this notation a name: *Visform*. I know, it doesn't sound great;
but it is what I got in 3 seconds. I think even by name, it is easier to read
than BNF, WSN, or ABNF. Please don't get me wrong. I don't suggest this as an
alternative to those formal and probably much more comprehensive forms. This is
just good only when served in addition to those.

## Visform

In this representation of syntax, a more visual approach is preferred.
