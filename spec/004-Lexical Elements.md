- Comments

## Comments

Go supports both
- *line comments* that start with // and stop at the end of the line, and
- *general comments* that are wrapped between `/*` and `*/`.

Line comments and single-line general comments are replaced with a space
character. General comments that span multiple lines are replaced with a newline
character.

Comments do not nest.
