# Constants

In this section, we will look into constants in Go language:

- Boolean
- Rune
- Integer
- Floating-Point
- Complex
- String

Constants are represented in different ways:

1. Literals that we talked about in the previous section.
2. By declaring an identifier as a constant and using it instead of repeating
   the literal itself in the code.
3. Constant expressions
4. A conversion with a constant result
5. Result value of some built-in functions.

TODO: Show each use of 5 that is mentioned in spec with examples.
