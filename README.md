# Go Spec Sugar Coated

## Status

I have just started writing so even the links below don't work yet. Please Star
or [Watch](https://github.com/hasanyasin/gospec/subscription) the project to
follow updates.

You can check the `.md` files in spec/ folder; but the most imporant part of this
project is the design of the text flow and overall user interface I am going to
provide. So these `.md` files are not representative of the output I am aiming.

## What
This is a sugar-coated version of
[The Go Programming Language Specification](http://golang.org/ref/spec).

For details, please see
[the introduction](http://hasanyasin.com/docs/gospec/001-Introduction.html).

You can read the HTML-rendered version
[here](http://hasanyasin.com/docs/gospec/).
